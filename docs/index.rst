Introduction
============

The `gpmap` package standardizes a data structure for genotype-phenotype (GP) maps.
This format can be quickly ported to network graph formats (via NetworkX).
Subset, manipulate, extend, etc. genotype-phenotype maps easily. Calculate statistics,
model evolutionary trajectories, predict phenotypes. Efficient memory usage,
using numpy arrays to store in memory.
