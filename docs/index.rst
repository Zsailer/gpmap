SeqSpace documentation
======================

A python API for analyzing large genotype phenotype maps. It defines a genotype-
phenotype map data-structure.

1. Easily construct sequence spaces from lists of genotypes
2. Convert any set of sequences into binary representations for modeling.
3. Flexible framework for managing the type of mutations that occur in map.
4. Paired with LatticeGPM, can easily construct lattice protein sequence spaces.
5. Uses the power of [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io) for network construction, enabling the use of their network algorithms.
6. Easily convert between Networkx objects and JSON data-structures.
7. Visualize networks with [NetworkViewer](https://github.com/harmslab/NetworkViewer) application.
