Accepted data format
--------------------

Currently, the ``epistasis`` package only takes JSON formated data as input to
the epistasis model. We expect to get include more formats (i.e. csv/excel) moving
forward, just haven't gotten around to it.

The only keys recognized by the json reader are:

    1. `genotypes`
    2. `phenotypes`
    3. `stdeviations`
    4. `mutations`
    5. `n_replicates`
    6. `log_transform`

All other keys are ignored in the epistasis models. You can keep other metadata
stored in the JSON, but it won't be appended to the epistasis model object.
